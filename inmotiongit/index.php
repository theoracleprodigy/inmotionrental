              Why not rent something you have dreamed about owning?
            </h2>
            <p class="tm-mb-6">
              At In Motion Rental, we pride ourselves in renting out premium vehicles.  These rentals are not the run of the mill products, but the stuff that dreams are made of.
              When it comes time to relax and enjoy your time why not get something you have wanted to enjoy?  The benefit is that you don't have to worry about maintenance, and
              purchase cost.  Just rent and enjoy.
            </p>
            <p class="mb-0">
              Don't see something you would like.  Let us know what you would love to rent.  We would like to accommodate everyone if we could, but inventory is somewhat limited.
              If there are enough requests for a vehicle we don't have, it might be the next purchase.  Our inventory can be found under the rentals tab.

                Rather than stick to street bikes we thought it would be fun to go off road as well.  These bikes give
                so many options to ride where ever when ever you want.

                Sticking with going off road, sometimes it's fun to use some human power as well.  We have
                some premium bikes just for mountain biking.  Full suspension and hard tail rentals.  Don't like
                those options we have a electric bikes as well.
